<!-- For each project, make sure you write about:

Why youâ€™re interested in it. -->
 
# Project 1
Transit Analytics Lab which is seeking to develop data-driven research and analytical tools for public transit and planning operations.
// https://github.com/transit-analytics-lab/spur/issues/64
This project seeks to add a function to log the current state of trains.
It uses python and Jupyter Notebooks.
I have a deire to get into the data analytics side of software engineering and I see this as a good project to get my feet wet.

# Project 2
